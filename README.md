## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
    - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - For the Forms

### What I learned

In this project, I not only learned how to integrate React with Tailwind, but also how to use React-Hook-Form an excellent tool for handling and validating forms, which was especially helpful for implementing form validation.

### Continued development

I will continue improving my skills with React and TailwindCSS to keep growing.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to use external fonts instead of local ones, so that everyone can identify the type of font I used for this challenge.
- [Remix Icons](https://remixicon.com/) - This helped me to the add icons in my website.
